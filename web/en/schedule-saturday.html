                <div class="talk" data-duration="30" data-abstract="One of the great strengths of Python is the incredible richness of its libraries. The standard library is already fairly good, and when you take into account the third-party ecosystem, Python’s is up there with the best in the world. Despite that, however, a great deal of effort has been wasted to get to this place. Consider Python’s HTTP ecosystem, which has many fantastic libraries. Unfortunately, there’s a stunning lack of code re-use across them: different HTTP libraries often have essentially no common code at all, despite doing extremely similar jobs. Sometimes this occurs in projects that are intended to be almost identical, such as requests and treq. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This talk proposes that the primary reason this occurs is because each library contains its own I/O layer. It explores exactly how this problem comes about, and discusses an alternative approach to library design that vastly has many benefits over the standard approach. It uses as its core examples many projects the author has worked on, including the only library he has written that he believes gets this right. It also talks about where this approach is used outside of Python to great effect to provide extra weight for the example.">Building Protocol Libraries The Right Way</div>

For most of them, it is still time-consuming and tedious to correct (beginners) student essays. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This talk will introduce some challenges in automatic English text correction. The objective is to present how it is possible to use Python libraries (scikit-learn, SciPy and NumPy) for spotting English mistakes such as: articles, capitalization and spelling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In order to train and test the classifier, an open dataset will be used: EF-Cambridge Open Language Dataset (https://corpus.mml.cam.ac.uk/efcamdat/). This will allow participants to reproduce all the steps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the presentation, the accuracy of the implementation will be compared to at least one commercial application. It will be discussed how this kind of work can bring value to existing educational applications. Limitations and further steps will also be discussed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This presentation is a successive work from the cooperation of Education First (language teaching institution) engineers and University of Cambridge language researchers.">Automatic English Text Correction</div>
